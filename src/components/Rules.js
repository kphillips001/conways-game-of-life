Each cell's behavior is based on it's eight surrounding neighbors, and each generation of the grid is a pure function of the previous grid state.</h4>

                <li >If a cell is dead and has less than 2 live neighbors, it dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                <li>If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes alive, as if by reproduction.</li>
                <li>If a cell is alive and has more than 3 live neighbors, it dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                <li>If a cell is alive and has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it remains alive.</li>
